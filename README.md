<p>I am a software engineering enthusiast with a strong foundation in Python and C#, gained through both self-study and structured courses. I've worked on various projects, such as creating a remote computer control tool in Python, developing a website, and building an antivirus using the TotalVirus API. I have experience integrating APIs and developing efficient, scalable solutions. Additionally, Iâ€™ve completed several courses from the National Cyber Directorate, which have enhanced my skills in cybersecurity and software development.

Beyond coding, I have hands-on experience building computers from scratch, which has strengthened my technical problem-solving abilities. I'm passionate about technology and constantly seeking new challenges to grow and refine my skills.
