I am a software engineering enthusiast with a strong foundation in Python and C#, gained through both self-study and structured courses. I've worked on various projects, such as creating a remote computer control tool in Python, developing a website, and building an antivirus using the TotalVirus API. I have experience integrating APIs and developing efficient, scalable solutions. Additionally, I’ve completed several courses from the National Cyber Directorate, which have enhanced my skills in cybersecurity and software development.

Beyond coding, I have hands-on experience building computers from scratch, which has strengthened my technical problem-solving abilities. I'm passionate about technology and constantly seeking new challenges to grow and refine my skills.
